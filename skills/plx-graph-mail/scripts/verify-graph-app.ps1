.SYNOPSIS
  Verify a Graph app-only credential end to end: token, consented roles,
  drive read, scoped send, and the negative send that proves mail is restricted.

.DESCRIPTION
  Reads MICROSOFT_GRAPH_TENANT_ID / _CLIENT_ID / _CLIENT_SECRET from the
  environment. Run it on the workstation after sourcing the secrets loader, and
  again from a cloud agent run so both surfaces are proven with the same checks.

  The negative tests are the ones that matter: if the app can send as, or read,
  a mailbox other than the allowed sender, the Exchange application access policy
  is not in effect and the credential can act on any mailbox in the tenant. The
  send probe targets the probe mailbox itself, so a policy failure lands a canary
  in that inbox rather than reaching anyone else.

  A negative test only counts when the allowed send PASSES. A credential denied on
  every mailbox produces the same 403 as a correctly scoped one, so a 403 read in
  isolation is not evidence of anything. On 2026-07-27 that false pass hid a
  credential that could read every mailbox and send as any user for several hours.
  Both negative checks now report INCONCLUSIVE rather than PASS in that state.

  Reads are checked separately from sends because the two are independently
  scoped: an app can be blocked from sending as a mailbox while still reading its
  message bodies.

  Never prints the client secret. Exits non-zero if any check fails.
